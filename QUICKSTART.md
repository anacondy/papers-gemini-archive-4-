Try `python3` instead:
```bash
python3 app.py
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If using Python 3:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Address already in use"

Port 5000 is busy. Either:
- Stop the other application using port 5000
- Change the port in `app.py`

### "Permission denied" on uploads

Check folder permissions:
```bash
chmod 755 uploads/
```
